<h1>Sailaja Lakkakula snips a play</h1>
<h4>THE BOOR by _Anton Tchekov_</h4>

<h6 class="SCENE">SCENE. </h6>
<p class="speech">   
 _A well-furnished reception-room in_ MRS. POPOV'S _home_.
 MRS. POPOV _is discovered in deep mourning, sitting upon a sofa,
gazing steadfastly at a photograph_. LUKA _is also present_.</p><br>

 <h6 class="LUKA">LUKA. </h6>
 <p class="speech">
It isn't right, ma'am. You're wearing yourself out! The maid and
the cook have gone looking for berries; everything that breathes is
enjoying life; even the cat knows how to be happy--slips about the
courtyard and catches birds--but you hide yourself here in the house as
though you were in a cloister. Yes, truly, by actual reckoning you
haven't left this house for a whole year.</p><br>

<h6 class="MRS.POPOV">MRS.POPOV. </h6>
<p  class="speech"> 
And I shall never leave it--why should I? My life is over.
He lies in his grave, and I have buried myself within these four walls.
We are both dead.</p> <br>

<h6 class="LUKA">LUKA. </h6>
<p class="speech">
There you are again! It's too awful to listen to, so it is!
Nikolai Michailovitch is dead; it was the will of the Lord, and the Lord
has given him eternal peace. You have grieved over it and that ought to
be enough. Now it's time to stop. One can't weep and wear mourning
Beauty can't last forever. When ten short years are over, you'll be glad
enough to go out a bit and meet the officers--and then it'll be too
late.</p><br>

 <p class="speech">
don't speak of these things again.
You know very well that since the death of Nikolai Michailovitch my life
is absolutely nothing to me.to him how _I_ can love. There, in the Beyond, he'll find me the same as
I was until his death.</p> <br>

<h6 class="LUKA">LUKA. </h6> 
<p class="speech"> 
What is the use of all these words, when you'd so much rather go
walking in the garden or order Tobby or Welikan harnessed to the trap,
and visit the neighbors?</p><br>
